Trap Attack
Trap attack is a game where you play as trappers trying to kill each other with animals you have captured and traps. 
You gain animals through eggs on the ground and can place rocks to protect you or put up a shield.
Players will have to deal with trees and rocks that will block your animals while trying to take down the other trapper.
